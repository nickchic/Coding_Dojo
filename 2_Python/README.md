I went to school for Graphic Design, learning HTML and CSS along the way. I been working as a Graphic Designer since graduation but have been slowly teaching myself coding.

I have given myself projects over the years to learn actionscript, java, and C. Most recently I have been creating my own game using Unity and C#. I enjoy Graphic Design but I feel that my mind is better suited for coding and I have grown to love it.

I hope to get myself a job coding after the dojo, with my skills as a graphic designer I hope to get something that will be in the front end and the backend. One day I hope to work in the video game industry.
