// 2. Skyline Heights
// Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline. Letâ€™s say you are given
// an array with heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest to you and extending away.Array [-1,7,3] would represent three buildings: first is actually out of view below street level,
// behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories high (hidden behind the 7-story). You
// are situated at street level. Return array containing heights of buildings you can see, in order. Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7]. Given [0,4] return [4]. As always with challenges, do
// not use built-in array functions such as unshift().
